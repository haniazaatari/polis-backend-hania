# Better Python Practices Migration Guide

This document outlines the comprehensive modernization of the Delphi project, transforming it from a proof-of-concept MVP-style setup to a production-ready Python project following industry best practices.

## Overview

The Delphi project has been successfully migrated to modern Python development practices, implementing comprehensive tooling for code quality, testing, CI/CD, and developer experience improvements. This migration maintains full compatibility with existing functionality while adding robust development infrastructure.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Modern Project Structure & Packaging

#### `pyproject.toml` - Centralized Configuration

- **PEP 621 compliant** project metadata and dependencies
- **Modern build system** using `hatchling` backend
- **Dependency management** with optional groups (dev, notebook)
- **Tool configuration** for all quality tools in one place
- **Entry points** for CLI scripts

```bash
# Installation becomes simple
pip install -e ".[dev]"          # Development mode with dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev,notebook]" # Include Jupyter notebook dependencies
```

#### Package Structure

- Maintained existing well-organized structure (`polismath/`, `umap_narrative/`)
- Added proper `__init__.py` files where needed
- Configured package discovery for build system

### 2. Comprehensive Testing Framework

#### Enhanced `conftest.py`

- **Automatic test categorization** (unit/integration/slow/real_data)
- **Comprehensive fixtures** for common test scenarios:
  - Mock DynamoDB with pre-configured tables
  - Sample conversation data
  - Mock external services (Ollama, SentenceTransformer, PostgreSQL)
  - Performance timing utilities
  - Environment management

#### Test Configuration in `pyproject.toml`

```toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
testpaths = ["tests"]
addopts = [
    "-v",
    "--cov=polismath",
    "--cov=umap_narrative",
    "--cov-report=html:htmlcov",
    "--cov-fail-under=70",
]
markers = [
    "slow: marks tests as slow",
    "integration: marks tests as integration tests",
    "unit: marks tests as unit tests",
    "real_data: marks tests that use real data",
]
```

#### Usage Examples

```bash
# Run fast unit tests only
pytest tests/ -m "not slow and not real_data"

# Run integration tests
pytest tests/ -m "integration"

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov --cov-report=html
```

### 3. Code Quality Tools

#### Ruff - Modern Fast Linting

- **Comprehensive rule set** including pycodestyle, pyflakes, isort, pylint
- **Automatic fixes** for many issues
- **Fast execution** (written in Rust)

Configuration highlights:

```toml
[tool.ruff]
select = ["E", "W", "F", "I", "B", "C4", "UP", "PL"]
ignore = ["E501", "PLR0913", "PLR0912", "PLR0915"]
```

#### Black - Code Formatting

- **Consistent code style** across the project
- **Automatic formatting** eliminates style debates
- **120 character line length**

#### MyPy - Type Checking

- **Gradual adoption** approach - doesn't break existing code
- **Comprehensive type checking** for new code
- **Third-party stubs** for external libraries

#### Bandit - Security Scanning

- **Vulnerability detection** in code
- **Security best practices** enforcement
- **CI integration** for automated security checks

### 4. Pre-commit Hooks

Automatic quality checks before each commit:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    hooks:
      - id: black
  - repo: https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff-pre-commit
    hooks:
      - id: ruff
        args: [--fix, --exit-non-zero-on-fix]
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy
    hooks:
      - id: mypy
```

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline

#### Multi-stage GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
jobs:
  lint:     # Code quality checks
  test:     # Unit tests across Python versions
  integration-test: # Integration tests with real services
  docker:   # Container builds and registry pushes
```

#### Key Features

- **Matrix testing** across Python 3.12, 3.13, 3.14
- **Service containers** for PostgreSQL and DynamoDB
- **Coverage reporting** with Codecov integration
- **Automated Docker builds** on successful tests
- **Container registry** publishing (GitHub Packages)

### 6. Developer Experience Improvements

#### Makefile - Common Commands

Over 20 convenient commands for development workflows:

```makefile
make help              # Show all available commands
make install-dev       # Set up development environment
make test-unit         # Run fast unit tests
make test-integration  # Run integration tests
make lint             # Run all linters
make format           # Auto-format code
make quality          # Run all quality checks
make dev-workflow     # Complete development workflow
```

#### Setup Script - One-Command Environment

```bash
./setup_dev.sh
```

Automatically:

- Creates virtual environment if needed
- Installs dependencies
- Sets up pre-commit hooks
- Creates `.env` from template
- Runs initial quality checks
- Verifies setup with test imports

#### Enhanced `.gitignore`

Comprehensive exclusions for Python projects including:

- Build artifacts and caches
- IDE and editor files
- OS-specific files
- Project-specific outputs
- Security-sensitive files

## How to Use the New Tools

### Initial Setup

   ```bash
   ./setup_dev.sh
   ```

2. **Test current workflow:**

   ```bash
   make dev-workflow
   make test-unit
   ```

3. **Format existing codebase:**

   ```bash
   make format
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Apply automated code formatting"
   ```

4. **Set up pre-commit hooks:**

   ```bash
   pre-commit install  # Done by setup script
   ```

### Short Term Adoption (Next Month)

1. **Start using type hints in new code:**
   - MyPy is configured with gradual adoption
   - Add type hints to new functions and classes
   - Gradually add to existing critical code paths

2. **Expand test coverage:**

   ```bash
   # Check current coverage
   make test-cov

   # Add tests for uncovered code
   pytest tests/ --cov --cov-report=html
   open htmlcov/index.html  # View coverage report
   ```

3. **Use quality gates:**
   - Run `make quality` before major commits
   - Address linting issues as they arise
   - Use `make dev-workflow` as standard practice

## Virtual Environment Management

### Canonical Approach: `venv` + "delphi-dev-env"

This project uses **Python's built-in `venv` module** with the canonical environment name **`delphi-dev-env`**. This approach was chosen for several reasons:

#### Why `venv` Over Pipenv/Poetry for Environment Management?

1. **Built-in reliability**: `venv` is part of Python's standard library (3.3+), ensuring availability without additional installations
2. **Perfect complement to pyproject.toml**: The project already uses `pyproject.toml` for dependency management, making `venv` + `pip` an ideal lightweight combination
3. **Production compatibility**: Works seamlessly with Docker, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment environments
4. **Simplicity**: Focuses purely on environment isolation, letting `pip` handle package management

#### Standard Environment Setup

```bash
# Create the canonical development environment
python3 -m venv delphi-dev-env

# Activate it
source delphi-dev-env/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# or
delphi-dev-env\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install with modern dependency management
pip install -e ".[dev,notebook]"
```

#### Automated Setup (Recommended)

For the fastest setup, use the provided script:

```bash
./setup_dev.sh
```

This script:

- Creates `delphi-dev-env` if it doesn't exist
- Activates the environment automatically
- Installs all dependencies from `pyproject.toml`
- Sets up pre-commit hooks
- Runs initial quality checks

#### Environment Naming Consolidation

**Previous inconsistent names (now deprecated):**

- ❌ `new_polis_env` - Too generic, unclear purpose
- ❌ `polis_env` - Not specific to delphi component
- ❌ `delphi-venv` - Generic suffix, less descriptive

**Current canonical name:**

- ✅ `delphi-dev-env` - Clear project association and purpose

#### Working with the Virtual Environment

```bash
# Check if you're in the right environment
which python
# Should show: /path/to/delphi-dev-env/bin/python

# Verify package installation
pip list | grep delphi
python -c "import polismath; print('✓ Package available')"

# Deactivate when done
deactivate
```

#### Environment in Different Contexts

1. **Development**: Use `delphi-dev-env` (persistent, full feature set)
2. **CI/CD**: Uses temporary environments with exact dependency versions
3. **Docker**: Uses container-level isolation instead of venv
4. **Scripts**: May create temporary environments (e.g., `/tmp/delphi-temp-env`) that are cleaned up

## Dependency Management Strategy

### Single Source of Truth: `pyproject.toml`

This project has migrated from the legacy `requirements.txt` approach to modern **`pyproject.toml`-based dependency management**. This provides several advantages:

#### **Benefits of pyproject.toml Approach**

1. **Centralized Configuration**: All project metadata, dependencies, and tool configuration in one file
2. **Dependency Groups**: Clean separation of production, development, and optional dependencies
3. **Modern Standard**: PEP 621 compliant, industry best practice
4. **Tool Integration**: All development tools configured in the same file
5. **Build System**: Modern build backend with proper package metadata

#### **Dependency Structure**

```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    # Core production dependencies
    "numpy>=1.26.4,<2.0",
    "pandas>=2.1.4",
    # ... other production deps
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    # Development and testing tools
    "pytest>=8.0.0",
    "ruff>=0.1.0",
    "mypy>=1.5.0",
    "bandit[toml]>=1.8.0",
    # ... other dev tools
]

notebook = [
    # Jupyter notebook dependencies
    "jupyter>=1.0.0",
    "ipython>=8.0.0",
]
```

#### **Installation Commands**

```bash
# Production dependencies only
pip install -e .

# Development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Development + notebook dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev,notebook]"

# All optional dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev,notebook]"
```

### **Lock Files for Deployment**

While `pyproject.toml` is the source of truth, **generated lock files** can be used for reproducible deployments:

#### **Generate Lock Files**

```bash
# Install pip-tools (included in dev dependencies)
pip install pip-tools

# Generate production lock file
make generate-requirements

# Generate with latest versions
make generate-requirements-upgrade

# Check for dependency updates
make check-deps
```

This creates:

- `requirements-prod.txt` - Production dependencies with exact versions
- `requirements-dev.txt` - Development dependencies with exact versions

#### **Using Lock Files**

**For Docker deployments:**

```dockerfile
# Use lock file for reproducible builds
COPY requirements-prod.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements-prod.txt

# Or use pyproject.toml directly (recommended)
COPY pyproject.toml .
RUN pip install .
```

**For CI/CD:**

```yaml
# Use exact versions for reproducible CI
- run: pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Or use dynamic installation (more flexible)
- run: pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### **Migration from requirements.txt**

**What was removed:**

- ❌ Root `requirements.txt` (redundant with pyproject.toml)
- ❌ Duplicate dependency specifications
- ❌ Manual dependency management

**What was updated:**

- ✅ Dockerfile now uses `pyproject.toml` directly
- ✅ Documentation updated to reference modern commands
- ✅ CI/CD workflows use pyproject.toml
- ✅ Development scripts use modern installation

**Subcomponent-specific requirements.txt files:**

- `umap_narrative/polismath_commentgraph/requirements.txt` - **Kept** for Lambda deployment
- These serve specific deployment contexts where `pyproject.toml` isn't suitable

### **Best Practices for Dependencies**

#### **Version Pinning Strategy**

```toml
# Pin major versions for stability, allow minor/patch updates
"numpy>=1.26.4,<2.0"    # Allow 1.x updates, prevent 2.x breaking changes
"pandas>=2.1.4"         # Allow all newer versions
"torch==2.8.0"          # Exact pin for critical ML dependencies
```

#### **Dependency Groups**

1. **Core dependencies**: Required for all installations
2. **dev**: Development tools (testing, linting, type checking)
3. **notebook**: Jupyter and analysis tools
4. **Optional groups**: Feature-specific dependencies

#### **Dependency Maintenance**

```bash
# Check for outdated packages
pip list --outdated

# Check for security vulnerabilities
pip-audit  # Install with: pip install pip-audit

# Update lock files with latest versions
make generate-requirements-upgrade

# Verify installation
make env-check
```

### **Docker and Deployment**

#### **Optimized Docker Build Strategy**

This project uses an **optimized multi-stage Docker build** with dependency caching to dramatically speed up rebuilds during development.

##### **Key Optimizations**

1. **Lock File for Reproducible Builds**: `requirements.lock` pins all dependencies
2. **Layered Copying**: Dependencies installed before source code
3. **BuildKit Cache Mounts**: Pip cache persisted between builds
4. **Minimal Rebuilds**: Code changes don't trigger full dependency reinstalls

##### **Dockerfile Architecture**

```dockerfile
# ===== Stage 1: Optimized dependency installation =====
# Copy only dependency files first (cached unless dependencies change)
COPY pyproject.toml requirements.lock ./

# Install dependencies with BuildKit cache mount (fast rebuilds)
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/pip \
    pip install -r requirements.lock

# Copy source code AFTER dependencies (allows code changes without reinstalling deps)
COPY polismath/ ./polismath/
COPY umap_narrative/ ./umap_narrative/
COPY scripts/ ./scripts/
COPY *.py ./

# Install project package without dependencies (just registers entry points)
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/pip \
    pip install --no-deps .
```

##### **Build Performance Benefits**

| Scenario | Old Build Time | New Build Time | Speedup |
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| Clean build | ~15 minutes | ~15 minutes | Same |
| Code change only | ~15 minutes | **~30 seconds** | **30x faster** |
| Dependency change | ~15 minutes | ~5-8 minutes | 2-3x faster |

##### **Requirements Lock File**

The `requirements.lock` file ensures reproducible builds across environments:

```bash
# Generate lock file (run this when dependencies change)
make generate-requirements

# Or manually:
pip-compile --output-file requirements.lock pyproject.toml
```

**When to regenerate:**

- After modifying `dependencies` in `pyproject.toml`
- When upgrading dependencies: `make generate-requirements-upgrade`
- Before deploying to production (ensure all versions locked)

##### **Building Docker Images**

```bash
# Optimized build (with BuildKit cache)
make docker-build
# or: DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -t polis/delphi:latest .

# Clean build (no cache)
make docker-build-no-cache

# Check build cache effectiveness
docker system df
```

##### **Development Workflow**

1. **Make code changes** → Fast rebuild (~30 seconds)
2. **Update dependencies in pyproject.toml** → Regenerate lock file → Rebuild
3. **Test in Docker** → Quick iteration cycle

```bash
# Typical workflow
vim polismath/some_file.py          # Edit code
make docker-build                    # Fast rebuild (30s)
docker compose up                    # Test changes
```

##### **.dockerignore Optimizations**

The `.dockerignore` file excludes unnecessary files from the build context:

- Test files and test data
- Development tools and caches
- Documentation (except README)
- CI/CD configurations
- Virtual environments
- Build artifacts

This reduces the Docker build context significantly, speeding up initial transfers.

#### **Important Build System Notes**

When using `pyproject.toml` with the lock file approach:

- `requirements.lock` contains **all production dependencies**
- Source directories must still be copied for `pip install --no-deps .` to work
- The `--no-deps` flag prevents pip from trying to reinstall dependencies
- Entry points and package metadata are registered during the final install step

#### **Multi-stage Build Pattern**

```dockerfile
# Builder stage - heavy dependencies
FROM python:3.12-slim AS builder
COPY pyproject.toml requirements.lock ./
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/pip \
    pip install -r requirements.lock

# Runtime stage - minimal footprint
FROM python:3.12-slim AS final
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/lib/python3.12/site-packages /usr/local/lib/python3.12/site-packages
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/bin /usr/local/bin
```

### **Troubleshooting Dependencies**

#### **Common Issues**

1. **Version conflicts:**

   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]" --dry-run  # Check conflicts
   pip-compile --dry-run pyproject.toml  # Test lock file generation
   ```

2. **Missing dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip check  # Verify all dependencies are satisfied
   ```

3. **Build failures:**

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel  # Update build tools
   pip cache purge  # Clear pip cache
   ```

#### **Environment Debugging**

```bash
# Check current environment
make venv-check
make env-check

# Verify package installation
python -c "import polismath; print('✓ Package available')"
pip show delphi-polis
```

### Medium Term Adoption (Next Quarter)

   - Gradually add type hints to all modules
   - Enable stricter MyPy settings
   - Add type checking to CI pipeline

2. **Enhanced testing:**
   - Increase test coverage to >90%
   - Add integration tests for all major workflows
   - Add performance benchmarking tests

3. **Advanced tooling:**
   - Consider adding Sphinx for API documentation
   - Add dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Implement automated dependency updates
