                    UMAP clustering analysis of participant voting patterns identified [number_of_groups] distinct 
                    behavioral groups within the conversation. These groups were formed based on similarity in

                    engaging with the conversation topics.

                    The participant groups varied significantly in size, with Group [X] comprising approximately 
                    [percentage]% of participants, while Group [Y] represented [percentage]% of the total. 
                    These size differences reflect the diversity of behavioral approaches within the conversation.

                    The most significant behavioral distinctions emerged in how groups approached [key_voting_pattern_difference],
